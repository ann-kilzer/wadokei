## History of å’Œæ™‚è¨ˆ

Early mechanical clocks were introduced to Japan by the Europeans in the 16th century. During Japan's isolationist period, from 1641, Japanese clockmakers built upon the technology from these first examples. By the Edo period, these skilled 
clockmakers were making clocks that followed the Japanese system of time, which divided used 12 Toki (hours), 6 for
the period of sunlight, and 6 for the period of dark. These clocks were known as å’Œæ™‚è¨ˆ (Wadokei) and were quite
complex due to the "unfixed" nature of the hours. Day Toki were longer in summer and shorter in winter, and night Toki were shorter in summer and longer in winter. 

How did the clock makers address this challenge?
1) Make the hands move faster during certain parts of the day
2) Change the size of the Toki regions

Toki names followed the Chinese Zodiac and Japanese numeral system.

By the early Meiji period, Japan switched to the standard 24 'fixed' hour time system, but one can still find
these mechanical masterpieces at clock museums in Tokyo and Matsumoto.

## This project

I built this project to improve my React and general frontend skills. It has a toggle between a western style clock and a å’Œæ™‚è¨ˆ. I adjusted the size of the hours based on the sunrise and sunset times, fetched from an [API](http://sunrise-sunset.org/api).

Currently it only tells time in Japan :)

Future enhancements coming ðŸ˜‡
