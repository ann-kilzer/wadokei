# About 和時計　（Wadokei)

## History of 和時計

Early mechanical clocks were introduced to Japan by the Europeans in the 16th century. During Japan's isolationist period, from 1641, Japanese clockmakers built upon the technology from these first examples. By the Edo period, these skilled 
clockmakers were making clocks that followed the Japanese system of time, which divided used 12 Toki (hours), 6 for
the period of sunlight, and 6 for the period of dark. These clocks were known as 和時計 (Wadokei) and were quite
complex due to the "unfixed" nature of the hours. Day Toki were longer in summer and shorter in winter, and night Toki were shorter in summer and longer in winter. 

How did the clock makers address this challenge?
1) Make the hands move faster during certain parts of the day
2) Change the size of the Toki regions

Toki names followed the Chinese Zodiac and Japanese numeral system.

By the early Meiji period, Japan switched to the standard 24 'fixed' hour time system, but one can still find
these mechanical masterpieces at clock museums in Tokyo and Matsumoto.

## This project

I built this project to improve my React and general frontend skills. It has a toggle between a western style clock and a 和時計. I adjusted the size of the hours based on the sunrise and sunset times, fetched from an [API](http://sunrise-sunset.org/api).

Currently it only tells time in Japan :)

Future enhancements coming.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
